# The Classics
The graveyard for all my old programming projects.

My GitHub was getting cluttered so I've decided to move my old projects into this repo in case someone wants to learn from it.

## Projects
* [QuickPush]()&ndash;A Chrome Extension that adds music to Spotify
* [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock in Leap Motion]()&ndash; Using the Leap Motion to play Sheldon's Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. *Note: didn't contribute much to this project. All credit goes to [Jongseung Lim](https://github.com/penandlim), [WHSBotBall](https://github.com/WHSBotball) and [Bruno Penetti](https://github.com/bpeynetti).*
* [My Old Personal Website]()&ndash;This is one of the many redesigns I've done while coding.
* [Farai's Weight Tracker]()&ndash; A weight tracker that went absolutley nowhere.
* [SoJava]()&ndash; A really bad "learn by teaching" exersice I did during my Java Class
* [Quote Generator]()&ndash; An old Free Code Camp Project that generates quotes.
* [Diary Locker]()&ndash; A Python script that encrypts webcam videos after recording.
* [Link Updater]()&ndash; A project I made in the spur of the moment. Not much use now.
* [QLapse]()&ndash;A Chrome Extention that lets you collapse Quora answers. Pointless now.
* [Retweet be Gone]()&ndash;A script that deletes old tweets and retweets. Also hides retweets from other users.
* [Share Center of Battle Creek Website]() An attempted development of a website for the Share Center of Battle Creek. THey went with WordPress instead.

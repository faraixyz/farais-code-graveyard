# Farai's Classic Projects
The graveyard for all of my old programming projects.

My GitHub was getting cluttered with noise so I've decided to move my old projects into this repo in case someone wants to learn from it. Doing this I realized that it wouldn't keep the git history of each project, meaning that I lost how I made all of this. Oh well ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Projects
* [QuickPush](https://github.com/fgandiya/farais-classic-projects/tree/master/QuickPush)&ndash;A Chrome Extension that adds music to Spotify

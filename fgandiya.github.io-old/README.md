# fgandiya.github.io/old &mdash; Farai's Old Personal Website

Initially a Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/fgandiya/pen/xwdepw with the live code [here](http://fgandiya.github.io/fgandiya.github.io-old/) 

Welcome to my old personal website. This repo also has code to a much older version of this site, which is burried under millions of commits (well [this](https://github.com/fgandiya/fgandiya.github.io-old/tree/c5e3baf7040b13e84361845a839982563c1efaf0) one to be exact). To see it, Install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby Gem. After you do that type `git checkout c5e3` to see the files at that commit stage and `jekyll serve --watch` to view it.

This repo also contains an experimental branch with a poor attempt at a website redesign. To see it, type `git checkout experimental` as well as `[jekyll serve --watch`.

This code is under the MIT license so have fun :).

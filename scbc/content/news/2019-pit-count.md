The annual Point in Time Count was February 6th and 7th with the SHARE Center being the central point of operations. We had 87 people come through for dinner, 75 for breakfast, and distributed 50 personal care kits, and 9 blankets. Huge thanks to the United Way of the Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Region and Eaton Industries for putting together the care kits!
